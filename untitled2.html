                <p>To what extent can the artist’s immediate reality and intimacy become art? 
                What resonance do these subjects have to the public, what context do they belong to and how can this kind of art avoid inconsistency? 
                These are questions that initiated the on-going project ‘provisionally’.</p>
                
                <p>The exhibition of this installation is an experiment of reception of art about the artist by the public.
                The installation consists of boxes that contain fragments from my personal archive of memories and experiences. 
                The boxes are the frame that intermediates the contact between the public and these confessive fragments.  </p>
                
                <p>Nothing is at sight, therefore the public must interract with the installation in order to discover its content. 
                Some of the boxes are locked, the public is free to decide to open them and lock them back or not. 
                It is also up to the public to decide whether they are willing to devote time to open all the boxes.
                The installation bears multiple readings, depending on the order in which the boxes are opened, on the number of 
                opened boxes and on the choice to turn the key.  </p>
                
                <p>‘provisionally’ functions as process of reflection on the tendency to exhibit fragments of personal life. 
                Their potential to make the public want to become a voyeur, empathize or be intrigued is the main filter of selection of these fragments. 
                The intention is to use a language that is rather honest than coded, but the relation between these characteristics constantly changes, 
                being influenced by the natural process of accumulating new experiences.  </p>
                
                <p>The main aim of such an archive is avoiding the blurring of experiences with the passage of time, 
                thus is can can be romantic and even cheesy. The challenge is 
                to transport this personal collection in a comprehensible frame.
                Moreover, this project has the ambition of questioning the relevance and the impact of 
                the contemporary art made out of recycled little 
                things of everyday life, 
                micro personal stories or the intimacy of the artist. </p>
